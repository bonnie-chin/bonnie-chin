## Hi! I'm Bonnie 👋

### I'm a Fullstack Developer @ UW Blueprint, Product Designer and 2nd Year CS student @ UWaterloo. 
I'm also an avid learner, **proud generalist**, and a psychology major in spirit 😄 Oh, and a proud mother of two big stuffies :)

#### My pillars
- 🤩 Bring moments of "wow" into the world for others 
- 💫 Create value by developing unique solutions and experiences
- 🔗 Connect ideas in new ways and with those around me 

#### What I'm up to:
- 😄 Searching for a Fall 2021 internship 
- 🔢 Reading "[Algorithms to Live By](https://www.google.com/search?q=algorithms+to+live+by&oq=algorithms+to+live+by+&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l8.6695j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)" by Brian Christian
- 📖 Binging Harvard Business Review articles (I'm obsessed with organizational psychology)
- 💬 Sharing randomly deep thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobawithbonnie)
