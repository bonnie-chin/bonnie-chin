## Hi! I'm Bonnie 👋

### I'm a Design Engineer @ Spatial, Product Designer and 3rd Year CS student @ UWaterloo. 
I'm also an avid learner, **proud generalist**, and a psychology major in spirit 😄 Oh, and a proud mother of two big stuffies :)

#### My pillars
- 🤩 Bring moments of "wow" into the world for others 
- 💫 Create value by democratizing complex concepts and services 
- 🔗 Connect ideas in new ways and with those around me 

#### What I'm up to:
- 🔍 AR/VR Research at the University of Waterloo's HCI lab
- 📚 Reading "[Algorithms to Live By](https://www.google.com/search?q=algorithms+to+live+by&oq=algorithms+to+live+by+&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l8.6695j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)" by Brian Christian
- 📃 Binging Harvard Business Review articles (I'm obsessed with organizational psychology)
- 📢 Sharing occasionally deep thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobawithbonnie)
